----HISTORY-----

unix was created (in 1969 by Ken Thompson andDennis Ritchie) before linux kernel(in 1991 by Linus Torvalds).
kernel allows the hardware to talk to the software, kernal controls pretty much everything.

----Choosing a linux distro-----

linux is actually quite a misnomer, since it actually refers to the linux kernel. However many distro use the linux kernel so therefore are commonly known as Linux os
linux system is divided into 3 parts :
1.Hardware:This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
2.Linux Kernel:Kernel is core of os.It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
3.User Space:This is where user will be directly interacting with the system.
