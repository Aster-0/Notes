----HISTORY-----

unix was created (in 1969 by Ken Thompson andDennis Ritchie) before linux kernel(in 1991 by Linus Torvalds).
kernel allows the hardware to talk to the software, kernal controls pretty much everything.

----Choosing a linux distro-----

linux is actually quite a misnomer, since it actually refers to the linux kernel. However many distro use the linux kernel so therefore are commonly known as Linux os
linux system is divided into 3 parts :
1.Hardware:This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
2.Linux Kernel:Kernel is core of os.It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
3.User Space:This is where user will be directly interacting with the system.

----Shell----

shell is a program that takes input and send to os to perform. Terminal or console these are programs that launch shell for you.
Bash(Bourne Again shell)
the shell prompt format is : 
username@hostname:current_directory
eg. pete@icebox:/home/pete $
$ is for normal users

echo cmd is used to print something
$ echo <text to print>
eg $ echo Hello world

whoami cmd tells you in which user you are loged in
eg $whoami

date cmd give you date and time

----pwd(present working directory)----

everything in linux is file and every file is organized in a hierarchical directory tree.
the first directory in the filesystem in aptly named the root directory(/).
the location of these file and dir are referred to as path
pwd cmd is to see where you are or your present working dir
$pwd

----cd(change directory)----

cd cmd used for moving around filesystem
$cd <path>
path are of two types
1. Absolute : this is the path from the root dir.
2. Relative : this is the path from where you are currently in filesystem.
shortcuts:
	.(current directory) - dir in which you are currently in
	..(parent directory) - takes you to the directory above your current.
	~(home directory) - this dir defaults to your "home dir".Such as /home/pete.
	-(previous directory) - This will take you to previous dir you were just at.

----ls(list Directories)----

ls cmd is used to list the contents of your present directory.
eg. $ls
or to list the dir which path you specified.
$ ls <path>
eg. $ ls folder2/ 
you can also use flags(option/arguments) to add more functionality.
-R for recursively list directory contents(show files/folder inside folder) , -r to list in reverse order while sorting and -t to sort by modification time , newest first.
-l for long and -a for all(hidden files) 
eg. ls -la
hidden files start with . 
eg .git .hello.txt

----touch----

touch cmd allows you to create empty files.
$touch <filename>
touch is also used to change timestamps on existing files and dir.

----file----

in linux filenames aren't required to represent the contents of the file. You can create a file called funny.gif that isn't actually a GIF.
to find what kind of file is we can use find cmd to show a description of the file contents.
$file <filename>
eg. $file banana.jpg

----cat----

to read a file we use cat cmd, short for concatenate it not only displays file contents but it can combine multiple files and show you the output of them
$cat <filename>
$cat <file1> <file2>
